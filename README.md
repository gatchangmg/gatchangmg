👋 Hi, I’m @gatchangmg, but you can call me Gatchang Mabany!
👀 I’m deeply passionate about technology, coding, Engineering and football. As a huge Manchester City fan, I enjoy keeping up with the latest matches and occasionally trolling rival teams for fun! Outside of football, I’m fascinated by how tech shapes our world, especially in programming and project management.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced programming concepts like data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and project management through a mix of academic courses and certifications.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects, particularly anything related to web development, network design, or innovative applications that connect tech and sports.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to check out my portfolio at Gatchang MG or connect via https://x.com/gatchangmabany1 .
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I once mapped out a full network setup for a client, complete with WiFi zones and LAN drop points, and it felt like solving a massive real-life puzzle!
